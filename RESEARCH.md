## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to investigate how we can build verified financial risk-aware smart contracts that can be deployed to the blockchain. This verification should lead to less error-prone contracts, whose financial properties are verified and ensured before being added to the blockchain.

## Motivation

Advances in economy and society have led to more complex transactions and contracts. Contracts which are often not easily understood, or that leave room for different interpretations. It is important to find a secure and verifiable way of designing such contracts. To do so, we can use distributed ledger technologies.

Distributed ledger technologies have become more popular over the last years, such as the blockchain technology, which allows for a distributed computing architecture. In this model, there are many nodes participating on the network and each transaction is announced to all nodes. Then, the nodes agree on a single order for the transactions. These transactions are grouped into blocks, which, in turn, are given a timestamp and then published. Each block is linked to the previous block in the chain, making it virtually impossible to fake a block[^8338007]. To this property we call *immutability*.

One of the most known blockchains is Ethereum, which is a public blockchain. By being public, it can be inspected and used by anyone. At its core, there are smart contracts. A smart contract is a program, usually written using a high-level language such as Solidity[^solidity], and then compiled into bytecode to be executed by the blockchain. Due to its immutable nature, a smart contract should work as expected. Any bugs or errors will ber permanent once a smart contract is deployed.

Over the last years, there have been many attacks to specific, well-known, smart contracts. For instance, in June 2016, the DAO smart contract suffered an attack that led to $60 million of ether to be stolen[^dao-attack]; in August 2021, the Poly network lost $600 million[^poly-attack]; among others. The impact of bugs like this in big economies can lead to massive losses and market disruptions. Then, it is important that we can deploy contracts where we have a certain degree of certainty that they are **(1)** bug free; and **(2)** do not pose a large financial risk to network as a whole.
