## Securing smart contract with runtime validation

- **Date**: Jun 11, 2020
- **URL**: https://doi.org/10.1145/3385412.3385982

Solythesis: source to source runtime validation tool, can enforce global invariants with quantifiers, runtime validation.

The authors mention that there's new languages being designed that can eliminate certain types of errors during compile time by limiting language expressiveness.

Conclude that runtime validation is effective and efficient for smart contracts as it doesn't add a lot of overhead.
